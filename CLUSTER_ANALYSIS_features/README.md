### GOAL: 
This code is used to quickly obtain a summary of the results of a batch of cluster_analysis .mat files. It will give you a wide variety of information from the analysis file, both about the cell in general, and about the generated cluster characteristics. The file will also contain the full path to the analized cell on the first column in order to be able to backtrack the data if necessary. It is not recommended to change the names of the files or move them from the original place, as it may complicated keeping track of the analysed data. 


### INPUT: 
.mat files obtained from the CLUSTER_ANALYSIS_main script.



### OUTPUT:
.xlsx file with the information organized in rows by cell, and columns for every parameter that we are looking at. 
The file name will be: "_Data_Summary".


-directory of the .mat file analysed

-Number_Orig_Locs: total original number of localizations in the raw .bin BEFORE the cluster analysis

-AreaLocs_um2= area occupied by localizations (um^2). Number of px containing localizations * (original px size (um))^2

-NumClusters: number of all clusters (Single+InIsland)

-InIslandClusters: number of clusters belonging to Islands

-SingleClusters: number of Single clusters

-NumberOfIslands: number of Islands

-mean (column H-O) and median (column P-W) for all clusters (column H-I-J, P-Q-R), InIsland clusters (column K-L-M, S-T-U), Single clusters (column N-O, V-W) of:
 - number of localizations per cluster
 - area (nm^2) of cluster. Ï€*(SIG)^2. [SIG=(sdx+sdy)/2] of cluster centroid coordinates.
 - NND (nm) between neighbouring clusters (distance between centroids of neighbouring clusters)



### HOW TO USE: 

1.	Open function "CLUSTER_ANALYSIS_features.m" 

2.	In 'Root', write as a string the folder of cluster_analysis .mat files you are going to run. The output will be saved as a .xlsx file just outside this folder. (Just add a "\" at the end of the string if you want the .xlsx to be written inside the folder.)

2.	Run the code

3.	Load the .mat files you want analyzed using the uipickfiles.m GUI. For it, just search in "Current Folder" for the folder in which the results are stored, select the files you want to obtain the results from and press "Add". Once finished selecting files, press "Done". On "File Filter" it is recommended to add the termination of the files we are interested in. In this case, write ".mat" there. In that way, the only files available for selection are the .mat files.

4.	Press 'Done' on the GUI

5.	Output will be generated and a .xlsx will be created just outside the folder previously defined.
